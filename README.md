# Grammar_Extension_Agentless
This extension enables Grammarly to function inside **Google Colab**, making it easier to refine your writing.
### **How to Get Started**
:one: **Install the Grammarly Extension** (if you haven't already). Then, sign in or create an account. (`optional`: You can also install any chrome extension related to grammar checking and it will work alongside **Grammarly**. I recommend this [extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ai-grammar-checker-paraph/oldceeleldhonbafppcapldpdifcinji?hl=en-US&utm_source=ext_sidebar)

:two: **Clone the Repo into a folder that will include only the Repository**. Then:
  - Open Google Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
  - Enable Developer Mode, which is located in the top right corner.
  - Click on `Load Unpacked` and select the folder where you cloned the repository.

:three: **Open Google Colab** and you're all set! Click on the loaded extension when you want to check your work.
